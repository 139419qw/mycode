# Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM or MoG) For Background Subtraction
This is a basic gaussian mixture model based on "Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking" by C.Stauffer for background subtraction using c++ and opencv.

Notice that this is different from the cv.BackgroundSubtractorMOG2.

I'll be very glad to hear your advice
If you have some problem using that,feel free to contact me.
