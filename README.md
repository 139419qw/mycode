This is a basic gaussian mixture model based on "Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking" by C.Stauffer for background subtraction using c++ and opencv.

Notice that this is different from the cv.BackgroundSubtractorMOG2.


If you have some problem using that,feel free to contact me
